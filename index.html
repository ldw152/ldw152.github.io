				<h2>Overview of Project</h2>		
					<p>Project Description – The Padawan IOS App project is a project aimed to develop an IOS application called Padawan. I have no previous experience creating an app or using tools such as Xcode or the Swift programming language.</p>
					<p>Purpose – The purpose of the project is to learn how to develop a functioning IOS application using a MacBook with the Xcode developer app and Swift programming language.</p>
					<p>Benefit - The Padawan app will allow users interested in learning and users interested in teaching to connect with one another. This is not just a discussion or help page, but the expectation is for the mentor to be available via text, phone, and video conference, to help the Padawan complete the activity. The activity types are wide ranging from home maintenance, auto repair, gardening, instrument and tool use, to hobbies and sports such as rock climbing, kayaking, sailing, and mountain biking. The benefit for the learner is that they learn how to perform or participate in a new activity with the guidance of an experienced mentor, along with trying an activity with loaned equipment to see if they enjoy it before making an expensive financial investment. Whereas, the benefit for the mentor is that they can share knowledge and increase participation in activities they are passionate about while helping others. Mentors also have the ability to offer equipment use that helps bridge the gap for a Padawan’s entry into an expensive activity.</p>
